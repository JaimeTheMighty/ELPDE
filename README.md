# A linear programming approach to solving PDEs

My 2019 summer research project at Rice University with Dr. Andrew Schaefer and PhD candidate Tayo Ajayi. 

This approach formulates PDEs, particularly boundary value problems into linear programming models and incorporate Python+Gurobi to solve for an approximate solution in high order polynomials.

Our approach is based on the collocation method. Compared with other numerical methods, our approach exploits the advantage of linear programming in its ease of adding constraints.
